# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template

- Description:
- Owner:

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items and track completion
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Share learnings across teams (knowledge base, brown bags, team meetings)
- Update process documentation based on retrospective insights
- Review and refine handoff protocols (see [Cross-Functional Handoff Checklist](octoacme-cross-functional-handoff-checklist.md))
- Encourage experimentation with new practices in time-boxed trials
- Build feedback loops into all stages of the project lifecycle
