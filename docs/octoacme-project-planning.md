# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Review and confirm all required roles are assigned (see [octoacme-roles-and-personas.md](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md))
3. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
4. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
5. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
6. Identify dependencies and integration points
7. Establish cross-functional handoff protocols
8. Create release plan and milestone map
9. Confirm communication channels and cadence with all roles

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs

## Planning Checklist
- [ ] Project kickoff held
- [ ] Backlog prioritized and estimated
- [ ] Release timeline and milestones agreed
- [ ] Definition of Done documented
- [ ] Initial test plan / QA approach drafted
- [ ] Security requirements identified
- [ ] Cross-functional handoff protocols established
- [ ] Communication plan created for all stakeholders

## Planning Best Practices
- **Involve all roles early**: Include UX, QA, Security, DevOps, and Support in planning to surface dependencies
- **Break work into small increments**: Aim for work items completable in 1-3 days
- **Define "done" clearly**: Ensure everyone agrees on what constitutes completed work
- **Plan for quality**: Allocate time for testing, security review, and documentation
- **Buffer for unknowns**: Add 20-30% contingency for unexpected issues
- **Validate assumptions**: Test risky technical approaches before committing to timelines
- **Document decisions**: Capture key decisions and their rationale in a decision log
- **Review dependencies regularly**: Dependencies can change; revisit weekly
